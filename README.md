# Lootbox
This is a Lootbox I coded in C++. It mimics the rolling system of a Gacha game except with limited amount of items vs unlimited.
Overall I only have one version of it programmed right now which takes a user input for the size of the lootbox and allows them to manually enter the names of the items
I intend to make a second version which lets you define the items in the lootbox in the code instead of in the terminal.

Thanks and if you enjoy this little project I did let me know!
